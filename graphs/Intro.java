	**GRAPH : graph is a collection of vertices and edges    G = (V, E)
	
	** DIRECTED GRAPH : Edges have direction (away from vertex or towards the vertex)
	
	** SELF LOOP : If a vertex is connected to itself by an edge, it is a self loop
	
	** PARALLEL EDGES : If two vertices are connected to one another, they are parallel edges
	
	** INDEGREE : No of edges coming towards a vertex
	
	** OUTDEGREE : No of edges going away from a vertex
	
	** SIMPLE GRAPH : A graph with no self loop and no parallel edges is simple graph
	
	** NON-CONNECTED GRAPH : A graph with more than one component
	
	** ARTICULATION POINT : A vertex which when removed, the graph becomes non-connected
	
	** STRONGLY CONNECTED GRAPH : A graph having no articulation point. That is every
	                             possible two components are connected by 2 edges
	   
	** TOPOLOGICAL ORDERING : If edges are only directing forwards, no edge is directing backwards
	
	
	** ADJACENCY MATRIX : A n x n matrix such that if ith vertex is connected to jth vertex,
	                      aij = 1 else aij = 0. If edges are weighted, aij = wij
	
	** ADJACENCY LIST : An array of linked lists, where ith position has links to all nodes, having
	                    position of vertex ith vertex is connected to and weight of edge
	
	** COMPACT LIST : An array of size (v + 2e + 1) is created. First v places are for vertices, 
	                  in that place pos is stored from where pos vertices connected from it are stored
	                  . v + 1 has sizeOfArr + 1. from v + 2 to end, vertices connected from 1 then 2,
	                  then 3 ... are represented
